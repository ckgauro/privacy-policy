        necessary to save or protect an individual’s vital interest, such as to prevent harm.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div id="section3">
    <h1>3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h1>

    <p><em>In Short:</em> We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid
      legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to
      provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to
      fulfill our legitimate business interests.</p>
  
    <p><strong>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</strong></p>
  
    <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in
      order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your
      personal information:</p>
  
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Consent.</strong> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use
        your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more about
        <a href="#">withdrawing your consent.</a> </li>
      <li><strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance
        with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or
        defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li>
      <li><strong>Vital Interests.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your
        vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the
        safety of any person.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <p><strong>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</strong></p>
  
    <p>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your
      personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied
      consent). You can <a href="">withdraw your consen</a>t at any time.</p>
  
    <p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without
      your consent, including, for example:</p>
  
    <ul>
      <li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way</li>
      <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
      <li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
      <li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</li>
      <li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next   of kin</li>
      <li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be   victim of financial abuse</li>
      <li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise    the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is
        reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a         contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>
      <li>        If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or
        rules of the court relating to the production of records</li>
      <li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business,
        or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the
        information was produced</li>
      <li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</li>
      <li>If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</li>      
    </ul>  

  </div>
  <div id="section4">
    <h1>4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h1>

    <p><em>In Short:</em> We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the

    <h1>5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h1>

    <p><em>In Short:</em> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this
      privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</p>
  
    <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this
      privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or
      other legal requirements).</p>
  
    <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or
      anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been
      stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
      processing until deletion is possible.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="section6">
    <h1>6. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h1>

    <p><em>In Short:</em> In some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland,
      and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may
      review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</p>
  
    <p>In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data
      protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information,
      (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; (iv) if
      applicable, to data portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated decision-making. In certain circumstances,
      you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by
      contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below.
    </p>
    <p>We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>

  <p>If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also
    have the right to complain to your Member State data protection authority or UK data protection authority.</p>

  <p>If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner.</p>

  <p><strong>Withdrawing your consent:</strong> If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information,
    which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your
    consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details 
    provided in the section <a>"HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?"</a> 
    below.</p>
    <p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when
        applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful
        processing grounds other than consent.</p>
    
      <p>If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at <a href="mailto:westernvocabulary@gmail.com">

  <p>7. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</p>

  <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT")
    feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing
    activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing
    DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism
    that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted
    that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy
    notice.</p>
